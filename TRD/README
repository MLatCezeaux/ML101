In order to run this notebook we advise you to create a new virtual environment. 

1. First make sure you can create virtual environments:  

    >>> python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
    
    
2. Create a new virtual environment for your activities:

    >>> python3 -m venv MLCezeaux
    
This will create a directory named `MLCezeaux`. You can now activate the virtual environment:  

    >>> source MLCezeaux/bin/activate

If everything is ok you will see the name of the virtual environment in the left most side of your command line. 
Install the necessary dependencies:  

    (MLCezeaux) >>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
 You should now be able to open the notebook using:  
 
     (MLCezeaux) >>> jupyter notebook
